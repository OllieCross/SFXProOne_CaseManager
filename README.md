## Project Overview

**Inventory Manager** is a comprehensive, full-stack inventory and event management application built for AV/SFX rental companies. It tracks flight cases, individual devices, consumables, reusable gear groups, and real-world events - all through a mobile-first web interface accessible from any phone or desktop browser.

The app supports QR code scanning (including legacy Google Keep QR codes), direct file uploads to MinIO, role-based access control via Authentik SSO, and is deployed fully containerised behind Traefik with Let's Encrypt TLS.

## Key Features

- **Inventory Management:** Track cases, individual devices, generic accessories (items), and consumable stock. Each entity supports photos, PDFs, and rich metadata.
- **Device Logbook:** Per-device maintenance and status history with timestamped entries (e.g. "Prism replaced", "Faulty discharge lamp").
- **Consumables Stock:** Track quantities of expendable materials (confetti, pyro cartridges, CO2). Stock is decremented automatically when an event completes.
- **Reusable Groups (Templates):** Bundle cases, devices, items, and consumables into named group templates (e.g. "Small Lights Package") to speed up event creation.
- **Event Management:** Create and manage real-world jobs/shows with full inventory assignment, stagehand crew lists, client contact info, and invoice status tracking.
- **Tanks:** Track SFX gas tanks (CO2, O2, N2, LN2, H2, butane/propane, water) with chemical compound, full/current capacity, fill bar (green >=60%, yellow >=30%, red <30%), notes, photos, documents, and a maintenance logbook.
- **Pyro Effects:** Track pyrotechnic effects with brand, category (T1/T2/F1/F2/F3/F4/P1/P2/Other), stock quantity, warning/critical thresholds, notes, photos, and documents; stock decremented automatically when an event completes.
- **Shopping List (`/shopping`):** Lists all items needing restocking - consumables and pyro split into critical (red) and warning (yellow) groups; tanks shown with a fill bar; links directly to each item's detail/edit page.
- **Issues page (`/issues`):** Lists all devices with Faulty or In Repair status (with their last 3 logbook entries); editors can submit manual issue reports linked to a device, case, stored item, item in a case, tank, or free-text "Other" description; individual issues are deletable with a confirmation modal.
- **Recycle Bin:** Deleting a Case, Device, Item, Consumable, Photo, or Document soft-deletes the record; items are permanently purged after 30 days. Admins can browse, restore, or immediately empty the bin from `/admin/recycle-bin`.
- **Light / Dark Theme:** Follows OS `prefers-color-scheme` automatically; a sun/moon toggle in the header overrides and persists the preference to `localStorage`.
- **User Profile (`/profile`):** Any logged-in user can update their display name and change their password via two independent form sections.
- **Admin - User Management:** Admins can create new user accounts (name, email, role, password) and delete existing accounts (except their own) directly from the Admin Panel.
- **QR Code Scanning:** Camera-based scanner with manual fallback. Handles both raw string QR codes (new stickers) and legacy Google Keep URLs stored on existing cases. Camera view shows four corner-bracket crosshair overlay to help frame the code.
- **Media Handling:** Upload photos (JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC) and PDFs directly to MinIO via presigned URLs. HEIC images are converted to JPEG client-side before upload. Images are resized and compressed (max 1920 px, quality 0.8) in-browser.
- **PDF Viewer:** In-browser PDF rendering via a self-hosted PDF.js worker.
- **Access Control:** Three roles - VIEWER, EDITOR, ADMIN - enforced on every page and API route. SSO via Authentik OIDC or credentials login.
- **Rate Limiting:** Redis sliding-window rate limiter on login attempts and file upload/write endpoints per user.
- **Audit Logging:** Admin panel shows the last 100 audit log entries (grouped by date) covering all entity changes (cases, devices, consumables, groups, events, items, tanks, pyro).
- **Backup System:** Three dedicated Docker containers run nightly at 02:00 - `postgres-backup` (pg_dump - gzip, 7-day retention), `redis-backup`, and `minio-backup` (volume archives via offen/docker-volume-backup, 7-day retention).
- **Update Snackbar:** After a version bump a blue snackbar appears on first visit showing the new version; auto-dismisses after 6 seconds; tracked per-browser in `localStorage`.
- **Changelog:** Release notes rendered from `CHANGELOG.md` at `/changelog`. The most recent version header displays a "Latest" badge.
- **PWA-ready:** `manifest.json` and Apple touch icons for iOS/Android home screen shortcuts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Inventory_Manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `AUTH_URL`
   - `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` (required when behind any reverse proxy)
   - MinIO credentials and bucket name
   - Redis connection string
   - Authentik OIDC client ID/secret (optional for local dev)

4. **Start infrastructure:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up postgres redis minio -d
   ```

5. **Run migrations and seed:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npm run db:seed
   ```

6. **Start the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   App runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Production Deployment

The app is deployed via Docker Compose. `entrypoint.sh` runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically on every container start, so migrations are applied without manual intervention.

```bash
# On the server
cd /home/user/inventory_manager
git pull
docker compose build
docker compose up -d

# First deploy only - seed the database:
docker compose exec nextjs-app node node_modules/ts-node/dist/bin.js \
  --compiler-options '{"module":"CommonJS"}' prisma/seed.ts
```

### Infrastructure (separate stacks)

- **Traefik** (`srv/traefik/`) - edge router, TLS termination via Let's Encrypt ACME, security headers middleware.
- **Authentik** (`srv/authentik/`) - OIDC/OAuth2 SSO provider. Groups `editors` and `admins` control role claims returned to NextAuth.

Both run on a shared `proxy` Docker network so Traefik can route to them.

---

## Security

- All API routes check session; unauthenticated requests return `401`, insufficient role returns `403`.
- Zod validation on all request bodies; invalid input returns `422`.
- MIME type allowlist for uploads: JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC (images) and PDF (documents).
- QR code uniqueness enforced at DB level.
- Redis sliding-window rate limiting on login attempts and presigned URL generation per user.
- TLS 1.2+ only with hardened cipher suite configured in Traefik.
- Security headers: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`.
- Non-root container user in production.

---

## Authentication

Login supports two modes:

1. **Credentials** - email + password stored in the database (bcrypt hashed).
2. **Authentik OIDC** - SSO via external Authentik instance. Role claim (`VIEWER`/`EDITOR`/`ADMIN`) is injected via a custom scope mapping using `ak_is_group_member()` expressions.

Sessions use JWT strategy. Session lifetime is configured to keep stagehands logged in for at least 30 minutes of inactivity.
