# Changelog

All notable changes to SFX Pro One Inventory Manager are documented here.

---

## v1.4.3 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Group form - item quantity**: adding an item to a group now prompts for a quantity; the item dropdown shows available stock in parentheses (e.g. "Hammer (4pcs)"); quantity is validated as a whole number and capped at available inventory; the requested quantity is stored on the group and displayed in the members list
- **Group form - consumable quantity validation**: consumable quantity input now validates as a whole number or a decimal with up to two decimal places; both dot and comma are accepted as the decimal separator; invalid input shows an inline error instead of silently falling back to 1

### Fixed

- **Group form - standalone filter**: device and item pickers in the group create/edit form now only list devices and items not assigned to any case
- **Group form - qty input width**: quantity input field for both items and consumables is now narrower (fits 1-2 digits), matching the visual weight of the field's purpose
- **Group form - qty input clearable**: quantity input changed from a number spinner to a plain text input, allowing the field to be fully cleared before typing a new value

---

## v1.4.2 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Event detail - case origin on devices and items**: devices and items that belong to a case now show the case name as a subtitle in the event detail view; for items the case name and comment are displayed together separated by a dot

### Fixed

- **Event form - case filter blocks already-added cases**: cases that have already been added to the event as a whole are no longer shown in the device/item case filter dropdown, preventing users from picking individual devices or items from a case that is already included in full
- **Event form - inventory picker uniform width**: all input fields in the inventory section (search, case filter, item select) are now full width; the qty input and Add button sit on a separate row below the item select

---

## v1.4.1 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Event form - case filter for devices and items**: when the Device or Item tab is selected in the inventory picker, a new "No case / case" dropdown appears between the search field and the item dropdown; selecting "No case" shows only devices or items not assigned to any case, selecting a case shows only devices or items belonging to that case; defaults to "No case" on tab switch
- **Issues - Tank type**: "Tank" option added to the issue report type dropdown; selecting it shows a tank selector; tank name is shown on the issue card in the list; requires a database migration to add `tankId` to `IssueEntry`

### Fixed

- **Event form - Add button height**: Add button in the inventory picker row now has a fixed height matching the adjacent dropdown, preventing it from appearing taller or shorter depending on context
- **Inventory - cases and devices sort order**: cases and devices on the inventory page were sorted by last-updated date; now sorted alphabetically by name, consistent with all other inventory entities
- **Issues - item type filtering**: the "Item" option in the issue report form now only lists standalone items (not assigned to any case); items inside a case are accessible via the "Item in a case" option added in v1.4.0

### Changed

- **Event form - device and item pool**: the device and item dropdowns in the event form now include all non-deleted devices and items regardless of case assignment; filtering is handled by the new case filter dropdown instead of being pre-filtered server-side

---

## v1.4.0 - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Issues - item in a case**: issue report form now has an "Item in a case" option that first shows a case dropdown, then an item dropdown filtered to items belonging to that case; makes it possible to report an issue against a cased item specifically
- **Edit case - move item to standalone**: the "Move to..." dropdown on each gear item now includes a "No case (standalone)" option, allowing an item to be moved out of all cases entirely; previously only moving to another case was possible

### Changed

- **Issues - form type selector**: label changed from "What are you reporting an issue with?" to "Type"
- **Issues - removed Device option**: "A device" has been removed from the issue type dropdown; device issues are tracked via device logbook entries and the Faulty/In Repair section on the Issues page
- **Issues - Item option**: the "Item" type now only lists standalone items (not assigned to any case); items inside a case are reachable via the new "Item in a case" option
- **Events - device picker**: device dropdown in the event create/edit form now only lists devices that are not assigned to any case

---

## v1.3.13 - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **Event form - button layout**: action buttons at the bottom of the create/edit event form now match the case editor layout - Save and Cancel sit inline on the left, Delete Event is pushed to the right; Delete is no longer a separate full-width button below the form
- **Event form - item quantity cap**: adding a standalone item to an event now validates that the requested quantity does not exceed the total stock; the item dropdown shows the available count in parentheses (e.g. "Hammer (4pcs)") and an inline error is shown if the entered quantity is too high
- **Inventory - Device "Lost" border and text**: left border and status label for Lost devices now correctly use the foreground colour token instead of a hardcoded black/white pair, ensuring proper contrast in both light mode (black) and dark mode (white) regardless of OS colour scheme preference
- **Edit case - scroll after add item**: tapping "+ Add Item" now scrolls the new row to the centre of the screen instead of the very bottom of the viewport

---

## v1.3.12 - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Events - delete event button**: edit event page now has a "Delete Event" button at the bottom with a confirmation modal, consistent with the rest of the app
- **Admin - clear audit logs**: audit log section now has a "Clear Logs" button that deletes all log entries after confirmation
- **QR scanner - crosshair overlay**: camera view now shows four corner brackets to help frame the QR code
- **Audit log - local time**: log entry times are now formatted in the browser's local timezone, fixing times appearing 2 hours behind for UTC+2 users

### Fixed

- **Events - card tap navigation**: tapping an event card now always opens the event detail page; editors access the edit page via the pencil button already present on the detail page (previously editors were taken directly to edit, bypassing the detail view)
- **Events - item quantity in detail**: event detail page was showing the item's total stock quantity instead of the quantity requested for the event; now correctly shows the per-event quantity
- **Events - qty input field**: quantity input in the event create/edit form can now be fully cleared before typing a new value; input is validated only when the Add button is tapped; items and pyros require a non-negative integer; consumables accept non-negative numbers with up to two decimal places and accept both `.` and `,` as the decimal separator
- **Inventory - title overflow**: long case, device, item, consumable, tank and pyro names now wrap to a new line instead of overflowing horizontally outside the card
- **Events - event title overflow**: long event names and venue names on the events list now wrap instead of overflowing
- **Inventory - Device "Lost" styling**: Lost devices now show a black left border and black status label in light mode (was incorrectly showing red, same as Faulty)
- **Edit case - scroll on add item**: tapping "+ Add Item" now automatically scrolls to the newly added row at the bottom of the gear list
- **User deletion**: deleting a user who has created cases, logbook entries, issues, audit logs or tanks no longer fails with a foreign key constraint error; all references to the deleted user across the app now display "Deleted user"

### Changed

- **Database - EventItem quantity**: `EventItem` now stores a `quantityNeeded` field (default 1) so per-event item quantities are persisted independently of the item's total stock quantity

---

## v1.3.11 - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **Admin - delete user**: clicking Delete now opens a confirmation modal (consistent with the rest of the app) instead of spawning inline confirm/cancel buttons; confirming the modal correctly calls the API and removes the user
- **Admin - delete user modal**: modal text was right-aligned due to inheriting the `text-right` table cell style; fixed by anchoring `text-left` on the modal dialog itself

---

## v1.3.10 - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Inventory FAB - item animation**: speed-dial items now animate in with a fade + slide-up effect and staggered delay per item instead of appearing instantly
- **Events - today highlight pulse**: the highlighted today event card now has a looping 2.5s pulse animation that breathes between a sharp green border/glow and a softer spread glow

### Changed

- **Pyro create page - submit button**: label shortened from "Create Pyro Effect" to "Create Pyro"
- **Inventory FAB - item contrast**: speed-dial items now use `bg-gray-100` (light mode) and `bg-gray-700` (dark mode) for stronger contrast against the page background and inventory cards
- **Events page - card interaction**: whole card is now tappable; editors/admins are taken directly to the edit page, viewers to the detail page; Edit button replaced with a chevron indicator
- **Inventory - Lost device styling**: left border is now white in dark mode (was black and invisible against the dark background); "Lost" status label is now black in light mode and white in dark mode for consistent contrast

---

## v1.3.9 - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Events - own crew tag green highlight**: the logged-in user's name tag on event cards is now green, making it easy to spot events you are assigned to

### Fixed

- **Recycle Bin - Empty button**: was only deleting items older than 7 days; now correctly empties all items in the bin regardless of age
- **Device detail page - scroll position**: page was opening scrolled to the bottom due to `autoFocus` on the logbook comment input; removed `autoFocus`
- **Inventory - device card border colors**: Lost now shows a black border, Retired a grey border, Rented a blue border (previously all three had no border color)

### Changed

- **Device status label**: "Rented to a Friend" shortened to "Rented" across all pages (inventory, device detail, case detail, event detail, event form, group form, device editor)

---

## v1.3.8 - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Events - own crew tag highlight**: the logged-in user's name tag on event cards is now displayed in green, making it easy to spot events you are assigned to at a glance

- **Event form - Start Date/Time gap**: column gap widened for better visual separation
- **Event form - Start Date height**: added `appearance-none` so the date input matches the height of the Start Time select on iOS Safari

---

## v1.3.7 - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Events - Today highlight border**: today's event card now has a solid 2px green border stroke stacked on top of the existing green glow, making the highlight clearly visible

### Changed

- **Issues page - Delete button**: delete button on reported issue cards is now red by default with no hover transition (mobile-first)

- **Event form - Client Details**: card is now always expanded; toggle button and chevron removed
- **Admin panel - layout**: Recycle Bin button moved to the same row as Create User (aligned right) and given a trash bin icon; user table padding reduced; email column previously removed

### Fixed

- **Pyro detail page - middot entity**: `&middot;` was rendering as a literal string between category and brand; replaced with the `·` Unicode character (same fix applied to the documents section)
- **Confirmation modal - backdrop blur edge on desktop**: backdrop changed from `absolute` to `fixed` so it covers the full viewport including the header, eliminating the visible clipped edge
- **Event form - Start Date / Start Time alignment**: both fields now have an explicit fixed height (`h-[42px]`) and `flex flex-col` wrappers so they align correctly regardless of native browser rendering differences; gap increased to `gap-4`
- **Device form - Purchase Date field width**: added `appearance-none` to the date input to prevent iOS Safari from expanding the field beyond the container width

---

## v1.3.6 - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Case editor - Devices section**: cases can now have existing devices assigned directly from the Create Case and Edit Case forms; devices are listed with a remove option; unassigned devices appear in a dropdown; in edit mode changes are applied immediately, in create mode assignments are applied after the case is saved

### Fixed

- **Inventory page - gear list Remove button**: Remove button on gear list rows is now red by default (was only red on hover) and vertically centered within the row
- **Confirmation modal - backdrop blur edge**: on desktop, a visible border appeared at the top of the page where the blurred backdrop ended; fixed by changing the backdrop from `absolute` to `fixed` positioning so it covers the full viewport including the header

---

---

---

## v1.2.8 - 2026-04-08

---

## v1.2.5 - 2026-04-08

### Added

---

## v1.2.4 - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Header - user avatar dropdown**: replaced the flat ThemeToggle + role badge + Sign Out row with a user avatar menu; tapping the avatar (initial + name) opens a dropdown containing Admin Panel (ADMIN only), Profile, Theme toggle (shows current value), and Sign Out (red, separated by a divider); dropdown closes on outside click
- **Header - active nav indicator**: active nav link now uses a solid filled pill (`bg-brand text-white`) instead of the previous subtle `bg-foreground/10` tint, making the current section immediately obvious

### Changed

- **Input focus ring**: upgraded from `ring-1` to `ring-2 ring-brand/50` on all `input-field` elements for better visibility when a field is focused
- **Inventory - all rows tappable**: cases, devices, consumables, and items sections now use full-row `<Link>` cards with a `>` chevron; the standalone "View" button has been removed from every inventory row
- **Events list - full card tappable**: each event card now has a full-card invisible overlay link to the event detail; the "View" button is removed; the "Edit" button is kept and sits above the overlay
- **Event detail - cases and devices rows tappable**: case and device rows inside an event detail now navigate to the respective detail page on tap; replaced "View" text link with `>` chevron

- **Invoice "Not Paid" colour**: changed from `text-red-400` to `text-amber-500` so it no longer conflicts with the Faulty device red used on inventory rows

---

## v1.2.2 - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Theme-aware logo**: logo swaps between the dark (`logo2.jpg`) and light (`logo.jpg`) variant instantly when the theme is toggled, on both the login page and the header

- **Changelog: "Latest" badge**: the most recent version header on the Changelog page now displays a blue "Latest" badge so the current version is immediately identifiable

### Changed

- **Destructive buttons - solid red**: all confirm/delete buttons (ConfirmModal, Purge Expired) changed from pastel `bg-red-500/80` to solid `bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white`; destructive intent is now unambiguous
- **Recycle Bin - Purge Expired confirmation**: clicking "Purge Expired" now opens a confirmation modal ("This will permanently delete all expired items. This cannot be undone.") before executing the irreversible purge
- **Event Detail - tappable phone/email**: client phone and email fields are now rendered as `tel:` and `mailto:` links so users can call or email the client directly from the event detail page
- **Inventory - consumable stock number**: stock quantity is now displayed as `font-semibold` text (up from tiny muted `text-xs`) so the value is immediately readable alongside the status bar
- **Inventory - device status left border**: device rows now display a 3px left border colour-coded by status - green for Working, yellow for In Repair, red for Faulty/Lost - giving at-a-glance health indication when scanning the list
- **Inventory - hide zero-value case metadata**: case row metadata (items · photos · docs) now only shows counts greater than zero; rows with no attachments no longer display noisy "0 items · 0 photos · 0 docs"

---

## v1.2.1 - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Admin: delete user**: admins can delete any user account (except their own) from the Admin Panel user table; a two-step inline confirmation ("Delete {name}? Confirm / Cancel") prevents accidental deletion
- **Login page redesign**: animated gradient orbs (brand blue, indigo, cyan) drift in the background using GPU-composited CSS keyframes; the form card uses glassmorphism (`backdrop-filter: blur`) with a slide-up entrance animation; logo springs in with a subtle overshoot curve; card shakes on failed login; password field gains a show/hide toggle; submit button shows an inline spinner while signing in; all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

---

## v1.2.0 - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Recycle Bin (Admin)**: deleting a Case, Device, Item, Consumable, Photo, or Document now soft-deletes (sets `deletedAt`) instead of immediately destroying the record; items are permanently purged after 7 days
- **Recycle Bin page (`/admin/recycle-bin`)**: admins can browse all soft-deleted items by category, see how many days remain before permanent deletion, and restore any item with one click
- **Purge Expired button**: admins can trigger an immediate purge of all items past the 7-day retention window (also deletes files from MinIO); accessible from the Recycle Bin page

---

### Added

- **Issues page (`/issues`)**: new page listing all devices with status Faulty or In Repair, with their last 3 logbook entries; accessible via a red "Issues" button in the Inventory header

---

### Added

- **Recent Events on case/device detail pages**: each case and device detail page now shows the 3 most recent completed or confirmed events that included the item, with event name, date, and a View link; shows "No recent events." when none qualify

### Fixed

- **Docker build: CSS opacity classes on CSS-variable colors**: Tailwind `text-foreground/70`, `bg-foreground/5`, etc. now compile correctly in the Docker production build; CSS color variables switched from hex values to RGB channel tuples so Tailwind can inject the alpha value

---

## v1.1.7 - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Consumable warning/critical thresholds**: each consumable now has optional `warningThreshold` and `criticalThreshold` fields; set them on the create/edit form with inline help text
- **Consumable stock status bar**: the inventory list replaces the plain quantity label with a horizontal fill bar per consumable - green when healthy, yellow at warning level, red at critical level with a `!` indicator; no thresholds set shows a neutral grey bar

---

## v1.1.6 - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Light/dark system theme**: the app now follows the OS/browser color scheme preference automatically; no manual toggle is needed
- **Light mode palette**: background `#f5f5f5`, surface `#ffffff`, foreground `#0a0a0a`; brand color and layout unchanged
- **CSS variable tokens**: `background`, `surface`, `foreground`, and `muted` are now CSS variables so all components respond to theme changes without JavaScript

---

## v1.1.5 - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **User profile page (`/profile`)**: any logged-in user can update their display name and change their password; accessed by clicking the role badge in the header
- **Admin: create user**: admins can create new user accounts directly from the Admin Panel via a "Create User" modal (name, email, role, password); duplicate email is rejected with a clear error
- **Role badge links to profile**: the role pill in the top-right header is now a clickable link to `/profile`

---

## v1.1.4 - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Event model: `endDate` removed**: events now have a single start date/time; all API routes, forms, and detail pages updated
- **Event model: `clientName` added**: new optional client name field available on create/edit forms and shown in the event detail view
- **Event form: crew section above inventory**: the crew (stagehand) picker is now a distinct section above the inventory picker, with a clear visual separator
- **Event form: items outside cases only**: the inventory picker no longer lists items that belong to a case; only standalone items (caseId IS NULL) are available to add directly to an event
- **Event form: group picker in create mode**: the group template picker is now available on the event create form (previously only on edit); expanding a group populates the inventory fields locally without requiring a round-trip
- **Event form: inventory search input**: a real-time search/filter input above the inventory picker filters across all inventory types (Cases, Devices, Items, Consumables) by name
- **Event form: 15-minute start time steps**: the start time picker is now a date input + time select with 15-minute increments (00, 15, 30, 45) instead of a free-form datetime-local input

---

## v1.1.3 - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Rebranded to "Inventory Manager"**: all visible frontend labels updated (page title, header, login page, PWA manifest name/short_name); backend, container names, and infrastructure unchanged
- **Inventory tab button labels**: create buttons now read `+ Case`, `+ Item`, `+ Device`, `+ Consumable` (removed the word "New")
- **Section renames in Inventory tab**: "Devices" renamed to "Devices outside Cases"; "Standalone Items" renamed to "Items outside Cases"
- **Edit/Delete removed from inventory list rows**: all four inventory sections (Cases, Devices, Consumables, Items outside Cases) now show only a blue "View" button per row; edit and delete actions are accessed from the detail/edit page
- **Events list: end date removed**: event cards now show only start date and time; end date display removed entirely from the list
- **Events list: inventory counts removed, crew names surfaced**: the per-event item/case/device count chips are gone; assigned crew members are now shown as individual pills (name badges) on each event card
- **Event details: "Stagehands" renamed to "Crew"**: section heading and all references updated; email addresses removed from the crew member list
- **Event details: "Back to Events" button removed**: navigation handled by the header
- **Events list: upcoming events highlighted**: events where the logged-in user is assigned as crew and the start date is today or tomorrow are sorted to the top of the list and given a glowing white 1px border

---

## v1.1.2 - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **Stale data after edit**: editing a case or device and saving no longer shows old data on the detail page; `router.refresh()` is now called before navigation to invalidate the server component cache
- **Audit log actions in ALL_CAPS**: audit log entries now display human-readable labels ("Created device", "Updated event", etc.) instead of raw enum strings; time of action is now shown alongside the date (e.g. "07 Apr 2026, 14:32")
- **Admin panel mobile overflow**: user table and audit log table are now wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` containers so they scroll horizontally on small screens instead of breaking the layout
- **Changelog page missing header**: the `/changelog` page now renders the standard `Header` component; the "Go Back" button has been removed
- **Inventory search only found cases**: the search input on the Inventory page now filters across all four sections (Cases, Devices, Consumables, and Standalone Items) simultaneously; case search still highlights matched item names within a case
- **Consumable edit page missing delete**: the consumable edit form now has a Delete button with a confirmation modal; wired to `DELETE /api/consumables/[id]`
- **Standalone item edit page missing delete**: the standalone item edit form now has a Delete button with a confirmation modal; wired to `DELETE /api/items/[id]`
- **Case and device edit forms missing QR code field**: the QR code / QR data field is now visible and editable in edit mode for both cases and devices, not just during creation; `PUT /api/cases/[id]` and `PATCH /api/devices/[id]` now accept the updated QR payload; device PATCH returns 409 if the new QR code is already in use by another device

---

## v1.1.1 - 2026-04-06

### Security

- **IDOR fix - logbook entry deletion**: DELETE `/api/devices/[id]/logbook/[entryId]` now verifies the entry belongs to the device in the URL path before deleting; previously any authenticated editor could delete any logbook entry by ID
- **XSS fix - changelog markdown rendering**: `marked()` output is now sanitised with `isomorphic-dompurify` before being passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; added `isomorphic-dompurify` dependency
- **PostgreSQL port hardened**: Docker Compose postgres port binding changed from `0.0.0.0:5432` to `127.0.0.1:5432` so the database is no longer reachable from outside the host
- **Rate limiter no longer fails open**: Redis `catch` block now falls back to an in-memory sliding-window counter (per-key `Map` with TTL) instead of unconditionally allowing all requests when Redis is unavailable
- **Item DELETE existence check**: `/api/items/[id]` DELETE handler now returns 404 when the item does not exist instead of surfacing a raw Prisma error
- **Item move - target case validation**: `/api/cases/[id]/items/[itemId]/move` PATCH now verifies the target case exists before updating; prevents foreign-key errors leaking to the client
- **Consumable DELETE existence check**: `/api/consumables/[id]` DELETE handler now returns 404 when the consumable does not exist
- **Authenticated version endpoint**: `/api/version` now requires a valid session; response is cached at module level to avoid a filesystem read on every request
- **MinIO CORS headers restricted**: Traefik `accesscontrolallowheaders` for MinIO changed from wildcard `*` to an explicit list (`Content-Type`, `Authorization`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-Content-Sha256`, `X-Amz-Security-Token`)
- **Rate limiting on write endpoints**: `checkRateLimit` added to POST handlers for `/api/cases`, `/api/devices`, and `/api/events` (30 requests / 60 s per user)
- **Presigned URL extension derived from MIME type**: file extension in the MinIO object key is now taken from a validated `MIME_TO_EXT` map instead of the user-supplied filename, preventing extension/MIME mismatch
- **Dependency overrides**: `defu` forced to `>=6.1.5` (prototype pollution fix) and `effect` forced to `>=3.20.0` (AsyncLocalStorage context leak fix) via npm `overrides`

### Infrastructure

- Backup system documented below (three dedicated containers: `postgres-backup`, `redis-backup`, `minio-backup`)

#### Backup containers

| Container | Image | Schedule | Retention | Output volume |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `sfxproone-postgres-backup` | `postgres:17-alpine` | Daily at 02:00 (via `sleep 86400` loop) | 7 days | `sfxproone_postgres_backups` |
| `sfxproone-redis-backup` | `offen/docker-volume-backup:v2` | `0 2 * * *` | 7 days | `sfxproone_redis_backups` |
| `sfxproone-minio-backup` | `offen/docker-volume-backup:v2` | `0 2 * * *` | 7 days | `sfxproone_minio_backups` |

- **postgres-backup**: runs `pg_dump | gzip` against the `postgres` service, writes compressed `.sql.gz` files to `/backups`, prunes files older than 7 days via `find -mtime +7 -delete`; depends on `postgres` being healthy
- **redis-backup**: mounts `redis_data` read-only, archives the volume to `sfxproone_redis_backups` nightly, retains 7 days of archives
- **minio-backup**: mounts `minio_data` read-only, archives the volume to `sfxproone_minio_backups` nightly, retains 7 days of archives
- All backup containers run on the `internal` network only; no external exposure

- Consumables on an event carry a `quantityNeeded` and optional `quantityUsed` field
- Add Group template to an existing event via the edit page (expands all group members into event inventory)
- Marking an event as Completed automatically decrements each consumable's stock quantity by its `quantityUsed`
- Events list page shows status and invoice status with colour coding, stagehand names, and inventory counts

---

## v1.0.7 - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Group model fully implemented: list, create, and edit pages at `/groups`, `/groups/new`, `/groups/[id]/edit`
- Groups are reusable event templates that bundle Cases, Devices, Items, and Consumables together
- Consumables in a group carry a `quantityNeeded` field (e.g. 2.5 kg titanium dust)
- Adding/removing members in edit mode saves immediately via API without requiring a Save button
- Events page "Groups" button now links to the live `/groups` page

---

## v1.0.6 - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Consumable model fully implemented: create and edit pages at `/consumables/new`, `/consumables/[id]/edit`
- Consumable fields: name, unit (free text, e.g. kg / bag / cartridge), stock quantity (decimal), notes

---

## v1.0.4 - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Database: new `Device` model with status (`Working / Faulty / InRepair / Retired / Lost / RentedToFriend`), optional case assignment, serial number, purchase date, notes, photos, documents, and a maintenance logbook (date + comment + user per entry)
- Database: new `Consumable` model for single-use stock items (confetti, pyro cartridges, titanium dust, etc.) with unit, stock quantity, and notes; stock decrements after event completion
- Database: new `Group` model as a reusable event template bundling Cases, Devices, Items, and Consumables (with quantity per consumable entry)
- Database: new `Event` model with venue, location, start/end date+time, client contact, stagehands (existing users), full inventory (Cases, Devices, Items, Consumables), status (`Planned / Confirmed / Completed / Cancelled / NeedsDetails`), and invoice status (`Paid / NotPaid / DepositPaid / DepositNotYetPaid / NotPaidInFull`)
- Case now stores `warehouseLocation` (free text, e.g. "Warehouse A / Shelf 3") and `notes`

- Events page header split into two rows: Row 1 is title; Row 2 (editors/admins) has + New Event and Groups buttons

---

## v1.0.3 - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Update snackbar: after a version bump, a blue snackbar appears at the bottom of the screen on first visit showing "App updated to vX.Y.Z"; auto-dismisses after 6 seconds; version is read live from CHANGELOG.md and tracked per-browser in localStorage
- Editors can now delete cases (previously admin-only)
- Inventory case cards now have a fixed-width button area so card width is consistent across all roles
- Gear list items can now be reordered by drag-and-drop; up/down arrow buttons removed; supports mouse drag and long-press drag on touch devices
- QR code label text size is now dynamic: scales up to fill the available width with padding, so short codes render large instead of small and fixed

### Fixed

- Moving an item to another case no longer causes the destination case name to bleed into the Move dropdown of the next item in the list (was caused by index-based React keys reusing DOM nodes after removal)
- Delete confirmations now appear as a centered modal overlay instead of inline text within the card; applies to case deletion from inventory, and item, photo, and document deletion from the case editor

---

## v1.0.2 - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Inventory search: live client-side filter input on the Inventory page that searches by case name and item names within a case; cases matched via item show the matching item names highlighted below the case metadata
- iPhone safe-area support: header now extends under the notch/Dynamic Island (`env(safe-area-inset-top)`), footer has padding above the home indicator (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`)
- Inventory search: matched item names now wrap across multiple lines instead of overflowing as a single truncated line; each item on its own line
- Search input clear button styled as a custom white SVG X, replacing the native browser icon which was not visible on the dark background
- New case creation now completes in one step: "Create Case" creates the case, uploads any pending photos and documents, then redirects to the case detail page - no second "Save Changes" click required
- PDF upload now shows an inline title and type form instead of browser prompt dialogs; document type is a dropdown (Manual / Certificate / Other)
- Document type enum values renamed from ALL_CAPS to CamelCase; added Bill, Order, Invoice, and Service Report types
- Edit Case button added to the case detail view for editors and admins, linking directly to the case editor
- Audit logging for all write operations - events are stored in a new `AuditLog` table and displayed in the Admin panel (last 100 events, most recent first)
- Logged events: `CASE_CREATED`, `CASE_UPDATED`, `CASE_DELETED`, `IMAGE_UPLOADED`, `IMAGE_DELETED`, `DOCUMENT_UPLOADED`, `DOCUMENT_DELETED`, `ITEM_MOVED`, `ROLE_CHANGED`
- Each log entry records the acting user, target resource ID, and a JSON metadata field (e.g. case name, file name, old/new role)
- New user account: `editor@sfxproone.com` with Editor role

### Changed

- Added Events tab to the header navigation (visible to all roles, placeholder for now)
- Moved Admin link from the header to the footer alongside Release notes; only visible to admins
- Renamed the "Editor" navigation tab to "Inventory"
- Inventory page is now accessible to users with the Viewer role
- Viewers see the full case list with "View" links but no write controls (New Case, Edit, Delete buttons are hidden)

### Infrastructure

- Added `docker-compose.override.yml` for local deployment (local volumes, exposed ports 3000/9000/9001, local proxy network)
- Updated `.env` with local-deployment defaults (`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `MINIO_PUBLIC_URL` pointing to localhost, generated `AUTH_SECRET`)
- Added migration `20260331000000_add_audit_log` creating the `AuditLog` table with a descending `createdAt` index

---

## v1.0.1 - 2026-03-26

### Added

- QR code generator modal in the editor: enter a custom label or auto-generate a 20-character random ID, renders a downloadable 1024×1024 PNG with a text label strip
- Footer on every page with credits ("Made by olliecross © 2026"), social icon links (Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub), and a link to the release notes

### Fixed

- File uploads in production were blocked by a Mixed Content error -presigned PUT URLs were signed against the internal Docker hostname (`http://minio:9000`). Introduced a separate `s3Public` client using `MINIO_PUBLIC_URL` so the browser receives a valid public HTTPS URL
- File uploads returned 403 Forbidden -AWS SDK v3 was adding a `x-amz-checksum-crc32` header to presigned URLs which MinIO rejected. Fixed by setting `requestChecksumCalculation: 'WHEN_REQUIRED'`
- File uploads returned 403 Forbidden -`PutObjectCommand` included a `ContentLength` of 20 MB, causing a signature mismatch when the actual file was smaller. Removed `ContentLength` from the command
- Uploaded files could not be viewed -presigned GET URLs were also signed against the internal hostname. `getFileUrl()` now uses `s3Public`
- PDF.js worker returned 404 -the CDN URL for pdfjs-dist 4.10.38 does not exist on cdnjs. Worker file is now self-hosted at `/pdf.worker.min.mjs` (copied from `node_modules`)
- PDF viewer only showed content after pressing "Next" -`renderPage(1)` ran before React had mounted the canvas element. Canvas is now always in the DOM (hidden via CSS while loading) so the ref is available immediately
- CORS errors on MinIO PUT requests -`PutBucketCorsCommand` is not implemented in this MinIO build. Removed the SDK call and configured CORS via Traefik middleware labels instead (`accesscontrolalloworiginlist`, `accesscontrolallowmethods`, `accesscontrolallowheaders`)

### Infrastructure

- Added `MINIO_SERVER_URL` env var to the MinIO container so it validates presigned URL hostnames correctly
- Added MinIO service to the `proxy` Traefik network and configured a public router at `minio.sfxproone.olliecross.com`
- Added `MINIO_PUBLIC_URL` to `.env.example`

---

## v1.0.0 - 2026-03-26
